    <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
    <p>
      All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
      and why you too should learn it.

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web
      developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a
      programming language).
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
